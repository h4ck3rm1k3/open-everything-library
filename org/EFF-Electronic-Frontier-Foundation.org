digital rights group based in the United States. EFF provides funds for
legal defense in court, presents amicus curiae briefs, defends
individuals and new technologies from what it considers baseless or
misdirected legal threats, works to expose government malfeasance,
provides guidance to the government and courts, organizes political
action and mass mailings, supports some new technologies which it
believes preserve personal freedoms, maintains a database and web sites
of related news and information, monitors and challenges potential
legislation that it believes would infringe on personal liberties and
fair use, and solicits a list of what it considers patent abuses with
intentions to defeat those that it considers without merit.
