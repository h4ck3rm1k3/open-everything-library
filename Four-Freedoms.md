Four Freedoms
=============

-   A program is free software if the program's users have the four
    essential freedoms:
-   The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose
    (freedom 0).
-   The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does
    your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is
    a precondition for this.
-   The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
    (freedom 2).
-   The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
    (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance
    to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a
    precondition for this. Source:
